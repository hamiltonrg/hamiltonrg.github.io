## Terms and Phrases

These are terms that are either uncommon, used inconsistently, or important enough to define clearly. Some of these may be my own phrasing or interpretations, not necessarily industry standards.

* **Forensics**: A broad term that may refer to legal forensic investigations or malware-focused forensic analysis.

* **Legal forensic investigations**: These may involve analyzing users, malware, or system artifacts with the explicit or potential intent of presenting findings in a legal context. Special considerations apply, such as chain of custody, defensible methodology, and reproducibility.

* **Basic forensic investigations**: Focused on understanding whether something occurred and uncovering associated details. These do *not* account for legal standards and may not be admissible or sufficient in legal proceedings.
